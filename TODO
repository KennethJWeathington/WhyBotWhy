Commands:
  ✔ Death Counter @done(20-04-12 18:06)
  ✔ Boop Counter @done(20-04-15 18:03)
    Check out how to interface with streamelements
    Make a cooldown https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41746916/cooldown-for-commands-using-node-tmi-js might help
  ✔ "Why" quotes @done(20-04-11 17:41)
    Make sure to capture who added it and when
  ☐ Behavior/rules on a timer
    Please remember the channel rules(:)
    1. Be Kind
    2. ~
    3. ~
    4. ~~~
    Descriptions are below stream for more information
    add a command that'll let you set how many minutes it repeats so you can adjust if necessary
  ✔ Add simple text commands @done(20-04-16 09:42)
    Make sure to sanitize commands
    Make sure to validate, ie check if command with that name already exists, check that a mod is the one creating it, etc
  ☐ alter simple text commands
  ✔ remove simple text commands @done(20-04-16 14:21)
  ☐ !followage
    Heres a good hint https://community.nightdev.com/t/how-to-do-a-followage-command/8996
  ☐ Add more features to !dice
  ☐ Add quote purge feature by user, only usable by mods
  ✔ Add reset death counter command, mods only @done(20-04-12 19:18)
  ☐ !commands
    Programmatically spit out list of commands
    Make a seperate one for mod commands, come up with a way to determine mod commands
  ☐ Auto sub thank
  ✔ Boopboard @done(20-04-15 19:33)
  !boopleaderboard would output like(:)
  Top Boopers(:)
  1. Fanfloh 65 boops
  2. Sayainking 49 boops
  3. PsychoticPAL 25 boops

Basics:
  ✘ pong reply @cancelled(20-04-11 13:13)
    About once every five minutes, the server will send you a PING :tmi.twitch.tv. 
    To ensure that your connection to the server is not prematurely terminated, reply with PONG :tmi.twitch.tv.
    Does it actually still do this? Maybe tmi.js auto-handles it? I've been waiting 10+ minutes and nothing.
    Okay after like 30 minutes I got "[02:46] error: Ping timeout.", I don't know if that was from Twitch or because of my shitty internet
    If it seems like it might be a problem here's how to test it: https://github.com/tmijs/docs/blob/gh-pages/_posts/v1.4.2/2019-03-03-Events.md#ping
    okay yeah no, we're good.
  ✔ hook up db @done(20-04-11 17:41)
  ✔ auto-reconnect @done(20-04-11 14:45)
    To re-connect to Twitch, follow the same process.  Best practice suggests trying again with exponential backoff (immediate, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, …).
    Looks like this is baked into tmi.js, connection { reconnect: true }
    Even has some best practice looking defaults for reconnection intervals
    I think it works but hard to test
    Looks like it works!
  ✔ debugging @done(20-04-12 19:18)
  ✔ secure connection @done(20-04-11 14:37)
    connection { secure} : Boolean - Use secure connection (SSL / HTTPS) (Overrides port to 443) (Default: false)
  ✔ check out debug @done(20-04-11 14:43)
    options { debug } : Boolean - Show debug messages in console (Default: false)
  ☐ hosting

    Heroku, glitch
  ☐ set up programmatic oauth
    To authenticate your chatbot in a production setting, we recommend you register your app (chatbot) and use the OAuth Authorization code flow. 
    This enables you to authenticate programmatically. To learn more, read the Apps & Authentication Guide.
    https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration
    https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication
  ☐ Switch to async
  ✔ Add metadata script @done(20-04-12 01:38)
    Find a way to parameretize the create so it can be one big metadata script maybe?
  ✔ put on github @done(20-04-15 18:43)
    for .env -->
    If your configuration file is called foobar.config, then you would commit a file called foobar.config.example to the repository,
    containing sample data. To run your program, you would create a local (not tracked) file called foobar.config with your real password data.
  ☐ JSDoc

Ideas:
  ☐ Write site gui
    A site backend to the bot where one can do things like view statistics (i.e. which commands are called the most) and manage commands
    and other data

Improvements:
  ☐ Switch metadata file to count
    More efficient and can check for count > 1
  ☐ Add summary to end of metadata file
  ☐ Async dc from db at end of gen metadata file
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39029893/why-is-the-mongodb-node-driver-generating-instance-pool-destroyed-errors
  ☐ Add some kind of emote handling for beginning and end of quotes
  ☐ Add 'done' message at end of data load using async and only connect to chat once everything is loaded
  ☐ Look into pausebuffer if I don't want to roll my own spam control
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@madelsberger/pausebuffer
  ☐ Maybe Parameterize and db-drive cooldown on commands?
  ☐ Interface with Streamlabs
  ☐ Add score comparison in order to determing when to optimally sort scoreboards
  ☐ Parameterize scoreboard size (i.e. top x places shown) and scoreboard message to refactor all scoreboards into single function
  ✔ Factor out document deletion once another document needs deleting @done(20-04-16 18:22)
  ✔ Factor out counter increment with pre and post save functions @done(20-04-16 18:24)
  ✔ Move all of the functions in the command map to their own functions @done(20-04-16 18:24)
  ☐ Add README
